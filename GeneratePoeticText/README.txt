Generate Poetic Texts using Neural Network


create virtual environment cmd
#  python -m venv env
#  cd env
#  Scripts/activate
#  cd..
#  pip install numpy
#  pip install tensorflow


First, uncomment the line to train the model using the file named textgenerator.keras.

Once you have trained the model, you can comment out the training section and proceed to step two in main.py to execute the code and generate poetic text.
